# Hedging

This application analyzes the relationships between different market indices 
to help determine hedge ratios between different securities.

## Usage
Select an Independent series and a Dependent series to chart and run simple
linear regression analysis over different time periods.

The Rolling Correlations show the correlation coefficients over different time 
periods and the distribution of correlation coefficients over the entire dataset.
This shows how stable the relationship between the two series is over time.
